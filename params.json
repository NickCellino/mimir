Lenses in Mimir are analogous to stages in an ETL pipeline -- responsible for performing data cleaning or analytics tasks.  However, unlike a traditional ETL pipeline, Lenses explicitly track conditions that could compromise data quality: Bulk data copies without considering data volatility, entity-resolution, missing values.  Lenses create the illusion that you're working with high quality data, allowing you to start analyzing the data right away.  Using the power of provenance, Mimir can tell you how reliable your query results are, and what you can do about it.\r\n\r\n# Lenses\r\n\r\nLenses are filters based on machine learning techniques that give you the illusion of working with high-quality data until you're ready to deal with the messiness of data cleaning.  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
